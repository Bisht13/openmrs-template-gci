What a fantastic time it has been. You've contributed to a vast extent of our OpenMRS enterprise, including improvements to the OpenMRS Platform, documenting and fixing bugs, designing awesome stickers and posters, creating tutorial videos for new members, and so much more. Throughout this contest, you also introduced yourself to the OpenMRS community - while helping other fellow students and members struggling with their tasks. So, as a representative ofthe OpenMRS community, we'd like to thank you for your hard efforts.
